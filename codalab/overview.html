<p>We invite you to participate in the Dialogue 2020 shared task on Taxonomy Enrichment for the Russian Language. Taxonomies are tree structures which organize terms into a semantic hierarchy. Taxonomic relations (or hypernyms) are “is-a” relations: cat is-a animal, banana is-a fruit, Microsoft is-a company, etc. This type of relations is useful in a wide range of natural language processing tasks for performing semantic analysis. The goal of this semantic task is to extend an existing taxonomy with relations of previously unseen words.</p>
<p>Multiple evaluation campaigns for hypernym extraction (<a href="https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/35249">SemEval-2018 task 9</a>), taxonomy induction (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S16-1168">Semeval-2016 task 13</a>, <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S15-2151/">SemEval 2015 task 17</a>), and most notably for taxonomy enrichment (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S16-1169/">SemEval-2016 task 14</a>) were organized for English and other western European languages in the past. However, this is the first evaluation campaign of this kind for Russian and any Slavic language.  Moreover, the task has a more realistic setting as compared to the SemEval-2016 task 14 taxonomy enrichment task as the participants are not given the definitions of words but only new unseen words in context.</p>
<p>More concretely, the goal of this task is the following: Given words that are not yet included in the taxonomy, we need to associate each word with the appropriate hypernyms from an existing taxonomy. For example, given the input word <b>“утка”</b> <i>(duck)</i> we expect you to provide a list of its most probable 10 candidate hypernym synsets the word could be attached to, e.g. <b>“animal”</b>, <b>“bird”</b>, and so on. Here a word may refer to one, two or more “ancestors” (hypernym synsets) at the same time.</p>
