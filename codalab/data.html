<p>We provide a training dataset (~10 000 words paired with hypernyms) sampled from the current version of the <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a> taxonomy. The test data is annotated manually according to the current snippet of <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a> and is split into two parts: public (763 nouns and 175 verbs) and private (1 525 nouns and 350 verbs).<p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Both training and testing datasets use the same <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a> synsets and are annotated in a similar way. They consist of three columns: word, hypernym id (synset id in <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a>) and hypernym as word (optional). Each synset of the predicted 10 should be written in a separate line. E.g.:<p>

<table cellspacing="15">
<tr>
    <td>утка</td><td>4839-N</td><td>сельскохозяйственная птица</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>утка</td><td>5349-N</td><td>водоплавающая птица</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>утка</td><td>...</td><td>...</td>
</tr>
