<p>We provide a training dataset (~10 000 words paired with hypernyms) sampled from the current version of the <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a> taxonomy. The test data is annotated manually according to the current snippet of <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a> and is split into two parts: public (763 nouns and 175 verbs) and private (1 525 nouns and 350 verbs).<p>
<br>
<p>Both training and testing datasets use the same <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a> synsets and are annotated in a similar way. They consist of three columns: word, hypernym id (synset id in <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a>) and hypernym as word (optional). Each synset of the predicted 10 should be written in a separate line. E.g.:<p>

<p>утка → 4839-N → сельскохозяйственная птица</p>
<p>утка → 5349-N → водоплавающая птица</p>
<p>утка→...→...</p>
<p>утка→...→ …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Please use tabs as column separators and save your solutions in the .tsv format. While submitting results please mention additional resources in the comments. The public test set for the practice phases may be found <a href="http://bit.ly/34lpj4X">here</a>. The list of private test set words will be provided by the beginning of Evaluation phases.
