<h3>Baselines</h3>
<p>We will provide simple baselines based on distributional and neural language models. 
Besides, we believe that popular neural context-aware models (like ELMo and BERT) will be of particular use for this task as they can represent out-of-vocabulary words on the basis of their context. Therefore, everyone interested in testing these and other distributional semantic models are welcome to participate.</p>
<h3>Tracks</h3>
<p>The task will feature two tracks: detection of hypernyms for nouns and for verbs. The participants are allowed to use any additional datasets and corpora in addition to the train set based on the <a href="http://www.ruwordnet.ru">ruWordNet</a> taxonomy. Moreover, we also provide the additional data: news text corpus, parsed Wikipedia corpus and <a href="http://panchenko.me/data/joint/isas/ru-librusec-wiki-diff.csv.gz">hypernym database</a> from <a href="https://nlpub.mipt.ru/Russian_Distributional_Thesaurus"> Russian Distributional Thesaurus</a>. However, we ask participants to mention all additional resources used for training of models.</p>
<p>The participants can test their models on the public test set by submitting the results to the leaderboards for each track (<b>Nouns</b> and <b>Verbs</b>). Once the private test sets is released, the participants will have two weeks to predict hypernyms for it and submit their final results.</p>
